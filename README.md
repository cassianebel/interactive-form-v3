# Interactive Form
For this project, javascript is used to enhance a form so that itâ€™s engaging, interactive, and easy to use.
## Features
### Focus
The focus is initially set on the Name field to get the user started filling out the form with ease.
### Conditional Input
Some inputs/content are displayed only as needed based on previous selections.
### Total Cost
The user's total cost is calculated based on their selections and displayed for reference.
### Prevent Conflicting Schedules
The activities section disables activity inputs that would conflict with any selections the user has already made.
### Form Validation
Required fields are checked for completeness and proper formatting.
### Real-Time Errors
Some inputs display errors as the user types so they know exactly what the form expects and when they have succesfully entered a value.
### Conditional Errors
The email input has conditional format checking that lets the user know if they have forgotten the "@" or "." in their email address.
